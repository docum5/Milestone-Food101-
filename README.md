## The Problem 
Recent growth in nutrition-related diseases globally has increased awareness of healthy nutritional habits. Healthy diets reduce the risks of reactions to food intolerance, weight problems, malnutrition and some forms of cancer. There are several applications in existence with which we can manually keep track of what we eat and identify food items before consumption. These applications, however, require that previous experience with the food item for easy identification. An important question, however, is: what happens if we see a food item for the first time and need to identify it? Automated tools of food identification will be of help in such cases. The advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep learning-based architectures have opened opportunities for the realization of such automatic tools. Indeed, a lot of mileage has already been made in neural networks based image food classification. However, there are still gaps in the accuracy of existing methods implemented. The recent state of the art results is ~76,3% for top-1 accuracy and 94,6% for top-5 accuracy. In response, I propose a technique based on a pre-trained EfficientNetB0 architecture that achieves the following accuracy on the test set:

## Goal
To beat the original results of the [Food101](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/) paper and beating [DeepFood](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304163308_DeepFood_Deep_Learning-Based_Food_Image_Recognition_for_Computer-Aided_Dietary_Assessment), a 2016 paper that used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77,4% top-1 accuracy.
